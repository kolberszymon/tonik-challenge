### Tonik Homework

Hi!

That's my proposition of your challenge implementation.

Just a few of remarks:

For caching I've used tanstack query
For table I've used tanstack table

The rest is mostly self-explanatory, probably we'll talk about it down the line anyway, so that's all :)

P.S.
Fingers crossed that it works also on your machine ðŸ¤ž
