### Tonik Homework

Hi!

That's my proposition of your challenge implementation.

How to run it?

1. Clone the repo
2. Cd into it
3. Type yarn
4. Create .env file from .env.example
5. Fill in your github token
6. Type yarn dev
7. enjoy on localhost:3000

Just a few of remarks:

For caching I've used tanstack query
For table I've used tanstack table

The rest is mostly self-explanatory, probably we'll talk about it down the line anyway, so that's all :)

P.S.
Fingers crossed that it works also on your machine ðŸ¤ž
